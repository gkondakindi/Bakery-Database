To install these examples:
1. Download WAMPSERVER http://www.wampserver.com/en/download.php
2. Put the contents in your c:\wamp\www folder.
3. Create database "phpexamples" and initialize it with "book.sql"
4. Create database "blog" and initialize it with "blog/blog.sql"
5. Use phpMyAdmin to create a user called "USERNAME" with localhost
   and no password, and then grant all privilages to that user.


Note: If you wish to use a different hostname/username/password, 
      you will have to modify "connectdb.php" and "blog\include.php"
      to reflect the changes.
